# Title: Employee Database Management System
# Author: Rushikesh Padaki
# Date: 24 May 2025
#
# Description:
# A menu-driven Python program to manage employee records using a dictionary.
# - Employee details are stored as: key = Employee ID, value = [Name, DOB, Designation]
# - Provides functionality to:
#     1. Create multiple employee records at once
#     2. Add a single employee
#     3. Search for an employee by ID
#     4. Delete an employee by ID
#     5. Display all employee records
#     6. Exit the program
#
# Algorithm:
# 1. Use a dictionary `Employee` to store employee data.
# 2. Display menu and prompt the user to choose an operation.
# 3. Based on the choice:
#    - (1) Create multiple employees by accepting details in a loop.
#    - (2) Add a single employee.
#    - (3) Search using Employee.get(ID).
#    - (4) Delete using Employee.pop(ID).
#    - (5) Traverse dictionary and print each record.
#    - (6) Exit the loop.
# 4. Validate user input for menu and ID presence.
#
# Time Complexity:
# - Insert/Search/Delete: O(1) on average for dictionary operations.
#
# Space Complexity:
# - O(n) â€” Where n is the number of employees stored.
#
# Sample Execution:
#
# ====== Employee Database ======
# 1. Create Employees
# 2. Add New Employee
# 3. Search Employee
# 4. Delete Employee
# 5. Display All Employees
# 6. Exit
