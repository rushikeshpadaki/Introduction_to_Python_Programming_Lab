#
# Description:
# A Python program to add two floating-point numbers and print the result.
# - Demonstrates the use of variables and arithmetic addition operator.
# - Shows how floating-point numbers are handled in Python.
#
# Algorithm:
# 1. Define two float variables, num1 and num2.
# 2. Add the two numbers and store the result in the variable 'total'.
# 3. Print the result using the print() function.
#
# Time Complexity:
# - O(1) — Constant time for basic arithmetic and printing.
#
# Space Complexity:
# - O(1) — Constant space for storing two floats and one result.
#
# Sample Execution:
#
# Case 1: Addition of 1.5 and 6.3
# Output:
# 7.8

num1 = 1.5
num2 = 6.3

total = num1 + num2

print(total)
